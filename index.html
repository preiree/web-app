        and parodic Facebook page of a fictitious "international, extraterrestrial, and mythical
        university system" of the same name.</p>

      <p>The satirical page features random personalities as "professors", "students",
        or "alumni". One of them is Filipino television host and weather forecaster Kim
        Atienza, who was "appointed" as the "dean of the College of Education". Atienza
        initially dismissed his association to the satirical "university" he first
        thought was a real institution of higher learning, and categorized it as a "scam"
        on August 6, 2022. Atienza, eventually, caught on to the trend and thanked ISCP
        for the "honor" of serving as its supposed educator. On his Twitter account, Atienza
        finally "accepted" the "appointment as Dean of Education", where he "required all
        students" to "submit" a "10-word reaction paper" on The Philippine Star article he
        "quote-tweeted".<br><br>Other Filipino personalities who have joined the trend are
        popular content creator Macoy Dubs, who called himself a "student"; Senator JV Ejercito,
        who expressed his intent to "apply" after "congratulating" Macoy Dubs;[9] singer Ace
        Banzuelo who projected to "run" for "presidency of the College of Arts and Sciences
        Student Council"; P3PWD representative and former election commissioner Rowena Guanzon,
        who was "hired" as a "law professor"; and stand-up comedian James Caraan, who joked he
        would "teach" students of "BS Marketing Major in Events Management".</p>
